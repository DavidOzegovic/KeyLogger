# KeyLogger
This is my first "malware," and I built a keylogger. While building this project, I learned windows api, how to create and write data inside those files. I learned how Windows watches for malware. This is the first version of my keylogger(this version is just logic for now), I'm gonna update this project every week or month until I'm satisfied with. In the next version, I need to do:
1. Encryption,
2. Connecting to C2 Server,
3. Stealth.
